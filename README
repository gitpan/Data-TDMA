Data::TDMA "works," as-is, but is kind of crummy. I am not sure what possessed 
me to write it the way it's written. I wrote it after I knew about things
like Class::Accessor and Params::Validate. I wrote it before I knew about
things like Moose and friends, but still, the code is just... egregiously
bad. And I apologize.

This package aims to do three things.

1. Make unit tests passable on non-64-bit machines.
2. Reduce the code-base substantially (or at least, don't do stupid things
   with code that can be better handled by something that does it by design,
   like design-by-contract packages, or autogenerated accessors, and the
   like) smaller.
3. Break out Net::TDMA into Data::TDMA because Net::TDMA never did any
   network communication anyways. Let somebody else do the Network work.
4. Suck less. See, you got one extra.
